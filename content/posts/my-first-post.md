Welcome to my game dev blog! As you can probably tell, this is my first post. 

The goal is to document my journey as I learn game development. I'm excited to see where this takes me.

We are going to be writting a fair bit of code here so lets test a code snippet:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```
