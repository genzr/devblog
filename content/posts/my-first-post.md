Welcome to my dev blog! As you might already tell by the title, this is my first post. 

The goal is to document dev stuff I think is interesting, and to do so in a way that other's will find useful. 

Let's see where things go!

We're going to be writting a fair bit of code here so lets test a code snippet:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```
